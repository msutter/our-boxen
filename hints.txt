10:56 < prismatictrail> possibly you're having the same problem I had? that was the error message;
                        see line 22 in githubtarball.rb
10:57 < prismatictrail> if someone cranked up the api security to require a user-agent just tonight
                        it could have broken this
10:58 < prismatictrail> my fix was to add  {'User-Agent' => 'boxen'} to the HTTP.Get call on line
                        120
10:59 < tgdsuma5> hey prismatictrail, thx a lot. I'll try this
10:59 < prismatictrail> I hear the proper solution is to upgrade librarian-puppet to 0.9.9 but I am
                        ruby-stupid so not comfortable doing that
